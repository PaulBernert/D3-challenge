          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <h5> Mouse over a circle to see more information about the data-point.</h5>

          <p>There appears to be a strong correlation between Income and Obesity, where
          people in higher incomes are generally less obese. It is to be expected, as there
        is often discussion around the fact that unhealthy ("junk") food tends to be less
      expensive when compared to healthy food.</p>

          <p>There appears to be some correlation between Smoking and Obesity, where states with
          a less-obese population tend to also have a population that smokes less. This could be
        correlation without causation, but it's an interesting observation nonetheless.</p>

          <p>There appears to be a correlation between the percent of the population in poverty
          against the percent of the population who has Health Care. There is a lot of literature
        that supports this notion, but one explanation may be that people who live in poverty are
        generally unemployed or work under-the-table jobs that don't require having health care.
      There's no real way to know for sure, but there definitely appears to be some correlation here.</p>
